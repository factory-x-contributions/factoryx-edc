## About The Project

The project is an extension for [Eclipse Tractus-X](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc) for the Manufacturing sector and is based on
 [Eclipse Dataspace Connector Project](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector).

## Inventory

The eclipse data space connector is split up into Control Plane and Data Plane, whereas the Control Plane functions as
administration layer and has responsibility of resource management, contract negotiation and administer data transfer.
The Data Plane does the heavy lifting of transferring and receiving data streams.

Depending on your environment there are different derivatives of the Control Plane prepared:

- [edc-controlplane-postgresql-hashicorp-vault](./edc-controlplane/edc-controlplane-postgresql-hashicorp-vault) with
  dependency onto
  - [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)
  - [PostgreSQL 8.2 or newer](https://www.postgresql.org/)

Derivatives of the Data Plane can be found here

- [edc-dataplane-hashicorp-vault](./edc-dataplane/edc-dataplane-hashicorp-vault) with dependency onto
  - [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)

For testing/development purposes:

- [edc-runtime-memory](./edc-controlplane/edc-runtime-memory)
