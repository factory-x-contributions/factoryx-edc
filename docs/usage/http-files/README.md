### Management API interaction via .http

The files contained in this repository are a machine-runnable subset of the [Management API Walkthrough](../management-api-walkthrough).
They can be run directly from VS code via the [REST Client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client). 
If you use a different HTTP client, the files should be understandable for humans, too. Even though each factoryx-edc 
has provider- and consumer-capabilities, they are separated in different files to demonstrate the flows on both sides.
